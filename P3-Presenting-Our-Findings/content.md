## Part 5: Exploratory Data Science (STRETCH CHALLENGE)

## Putting It All Together

Congrats! You've made it!

You've successfully gone from looking at raw, barely cleaned data with a couple of scrambled questions and an insightful eye for detail and produced a series of meaningful data-driven responses borne out of powerful data analyses and visualizations that catch the eye! 

The $64,000 question is: **so what**?

As you'll find in many STEM-related fields, and *especially* in software, the power of being able to **show** your research and efforts is oftentimes more valued than the research/efforts themselves. 

Presentability and clarity are **critical** to data analysts, engineers, and scientists, as it is their way of being able to convince the world of their findings and results. 

Likewise, your journey in the world of data science is contingent on your ability to **prove** that you know what you're talking about with effective visualizations and presentations that convey your findings! 

Luckily, there are several ways we can do so.

### Powerpoint/Google Slides

### Jupyter Slides

Jupyter Slides is an extremely powerful way to generate HTML-based slides directly from your notebook. 

Through Jupyter Slides, you'll be able to maintain all your presentation code in the *same exact* notebook that you did all your data analysis and exploration in, while generating a customized web presentation. 

Take a look at [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67) that thoroughly explains the setup process for Jupyter Slides.
