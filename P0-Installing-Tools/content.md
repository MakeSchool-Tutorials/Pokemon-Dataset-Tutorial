title: "Get started writing Jupyter Notebooks!"
slug: jupyter-notebooks
---

Welcome! This set of tutorials is built to get total beginners started with the fundamentals of computational data analysis, the foundations of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

**There are no prerequisites for this tutorial**, but you will need to have a Mac computer.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

1. Use Jupyter Notebooks and Python to read and analyze data sets
1. Compute the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of a data set
1. Make graphs and plots of data
1. Make a predictive model using line-of-best-fit

# What Tools Will We Use?

In this tutorial, we're only going to be focusing on setting up and establishing our workspace for working with intermediate and advanced Python tools - like Jupyter, Anaconda, and accessory libraries like Pandas and MatPlotLib.

Anaconda comes installed with:

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Accessory Python Libraries
- Visual Studio Code
- And it ensures Python is up-to-date (we will be using Python 3+!).

# Installing Anaconda

Please follow this tutorial to install Anaconda on your computer:

# Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an industry standard for simultaneously manipulating and publishing data. They are an incredible tool and we are super lucky to have them starting day one of your learning computational statistics and data science.

Watch this video and follow along with it. By the end, you should have created a Jupyter notebook that looks like the one in the video.
