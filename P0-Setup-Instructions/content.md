### **Welcome to Part 0 of the tutorial series on basic exploratory data science!**

In this tutorial, we're only going to be focusing on setting up and establishing our workspace for working with intermediate and advanced Python tools - like Jupyter, Anaconda, and accessory libraries like Pandas and MatPlotLib. 

Install Anaconda Navigator (link [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-mac-os-x)). 

Anaconda comes installed with:

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Accessory Python Libraries
- Visual Studio Code

Ensure Python is up-to-date (tutorial relies on Python 3+).
